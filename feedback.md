#2 - Still have to press right thumbstick up to "leave" when joined as player

* Love the swap mechanic for guns, while a little easy to pick up them when you don't mean to as it's automatic (maybe needs to be a concious action?) you can super easily rectify that by just running over again. In a hectic fight it could be detrimental if you swap guns if you didn't mean to.

* Did notice the occassional slow down in game speed, not sure what's triggering that at the moment

* Was none obvious to select the pick up, accidently got a pickup I didn't want as was standing in the wrong position. I wanted to shot the one on the right (figured I needed to shoot it from audio cue, so good design work there) but because I standing over the one on the right and shot to the left the center one was chosen. Maybe if it breaks and I have to confirm it by running over and physically picking up the item then it might prevent accidentally getting the wrong power up?

* None obvious what the secondary bar is underneth the ammo counter is, from player it may appear to confir extra damage? Helpful if explained to player somewhere

* sometimes it feels like the collision detection for the stomp is slightly off, I swear about 4-5 times now I've just been walking across the ground without pressing jump until maybe 2-3 frames after I've collided with a creature and it still registered as a stomp kill even though I was travelling upwards. Just feels slightly off but can't quite describe how yet.

* I could join game using the B button as well as the A button as B is also mapped to jump (two different jump buttons)

* some sort of sign to show to head back to the lift to exit, maybe like flashing neon sign like the emergency exit signs?

* I still hate thos jumping green bugs XD
  
* floor 9 (introduction of shelled worms flying in air) and floor 14 (introduction of green jumpy things) are still consistently the floors where I probably experience the most deaths
  
* floor 19 feels underpowered again compared to level before and after
#10 - floor 9
#11 - floor 20
* floor 9 feels like it totally changes the pace of the game, goes from fast paced to slow as to avoid risking losing health I just wait for the shelled worms to come down low so I can jump on them. Really breaks the flow of the game.
* floor 18 was facing the opposite direction to the small crawling worm when it walked up to be from behind, I think it made me stomp kill it without even pressing anything. I think this could be a possible trigger for it?
#12 - floor 1
* Nope, facing the opposite way from a small worm doesn't trigger the stomp kill XD

* Allow mouse buttons to be bind
* If you put yourself in bottom right corner, explosive flies only attack you by the front
* Turret: lots of bullets end up on the floor + unmoving = boring
    * > le combat pourrait être sympa mais il bouge pas du centre de la salle et malheureusement la moitié de ses tirs se cassent instantanément contre le sol quand tu es toi aussi au sol, du coup je l'ai juste battu en restant dans un coin et en sautant occasionnellement pour éviter un tir (il faudrait peut-être restreindre l'angle des tirs pour éviter qu'il bourre le sol)
* Tirer = aimerait pouvoir viser avec clavier ou souris
