# Bugscraper changelog
## 0.6
First Steam beta release (after a year of development, never too late..!) If you had the game before, I'm sorry to say that this release will reset your progress (skins & upgrades). I'll work on a more permanent solution in the future but right now this the best way I found to avoid incompatibility bugs. Be expected for this to happen often in a game still in beta. :P

- **Added**: Option to replay the tutorial in the settings  
- **Added**: You can press down to go through platforms
- **Change**: Various improvements to the tutorial
- **Change**: Improved flying nests (temporary name): now only shoot in defined directions and will flash before exploding after being killed

- **Change**: Honeypot footballs (temporary name) explode faster so it doesn't ruin your combo

- **Change**: Increased opacity for Stink bug poison cloud
