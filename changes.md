# Bugscraper changelog
## 0.6
First Steam beta release after a year of development! If you had the game before, I'm sorry to say that this release will reset your progress (skins & upgrades). I'll work on a more permanent solution in the solution but right now this the best way I found to avoid incompatibility bugs. Be expected for this to happen in a game still in beta. :P

- **Added**: Option to replay the tutorial in the settings  
- **Added**: You can press down to go through platforms
- **Added**: You now have more upgrades when first starting the game to avoid cases wher upgrade jars would spawn empty 
- **Change**: Honeypot footballs (temporary name) explode faster so it doesn't ruin your combo
- **Change**: You can no longer attack dept. 2 bee boss with bullets
- **Change**: Increased opacity for Stink bug poison cloud
- **Fix**: Quick restarting no longer has that small “intro”
- **Fix**: Drill bees (temporary name) now give some fury when exploding
- **Fix**: Ground floor music no longer plays when reviving a player
